# Changelog

All notable changes to Kotiko. From the next release on, this file is generated from
Conventional Commits by release-please.

## Unreleased

- Adding a word now answers within 25 seconds, uses at most 3 requests, and remembers
  words it already looked up for 30 days. Kotiko follows OpenRouter's current free models
  automatically (best first, from our evaluation) and shows how many free lookups you have
  left today. When lookups stop working, the popup says why in plain words (busy, used up
  until a given time, or a key problem) instead of "the language model failed". The words
  you look up no longer appear in the server's log. The server adds a table for the lookup
  cache, so it backs up your database once more on first start.

- **Slovo is now Kotiko.** Your words move automatically from `~/.local/share/slovo` to
  `~/.local/share/kotiko` on first start; the old file is kept as a backup. The service is
  now called `kotiko` (`install-service.sh` replaces the old one). Rename `SLOVO_DATA_DIR`
  to `KOTIKO_DATA_DIR` in `.env` if you set it (and `SLOVO_LOG_SQL` to `KOTIKO_LOG_SQL`);
  the old names still work for now, with a warning. Stop the old server before the first
  start; keep the extension's folder where it is and reload it. See "Updating from Slovo"
  in the README.
- Buttons, toggles, menus, tabs and forms keep the site's own words, including clickable
  labels built from plain `div`s. A lone capital next to a code or numeral ("AOI I",
  "World War I", "I-95") is no longer swapped as the word "I".

- Language names now come from the language code, so Cantonese is always Cantonese. Words
  saved under old codes such as cmn or iw were merged into their languages; the server
  backs up your database before it does this.
- Kotiko now checks every word the model suggests: it won't swap unrelated words like
  "what" for как, never adds more than 5 words at once, and explains anything it rejects.
  Ask in your own language, and meanings come back in the languages you read. Every new
  word comes with how to say it, written for readers of your language, with the stressed
  syllable in capitals.

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-01)

- Any language, mixed however you like: choose which languages show from the popup.
- Add words straight from the popup; the Telegram bot is optional.
- Word lookups use free OpenRouter models, falling back across several when one is busy.
- Security: the server's API denies by default, so encoded paths can no longer skip the
  token check.

## 0.1.0

- First version: Russian and Mandarin, words added through a Telegram bot.
